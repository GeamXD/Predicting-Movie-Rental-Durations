🎬 **Project Recap: Predicting DVD Rental Lengths** 🎥

1️⃣ **Objective**: Develop regression models to predict rental durations, helping the company optimize inventory.

2️⃣ **Data**: Features included rental rates, movie length, release year, etc.

3️⃣ **Steps**:
- Basic data cleaning and feature engineering (e.g., dummy variables, target column setup).
- Data split (80% train, 20% test).
- Experimented with multiple regression models.

4️⃣ **Metric**: **Main focus was achieving MSE < 3**, not extensive data exploration.

5️⃣ **Key Insights**:
- Top predictive features: `AMOUNT`, `RENTAL RATE`, and `NC-17`.
- Best performance: Random Forest Regressor (MSE = 2.15) with logarithmic preprocessing for numeric features.

6️⃣ **Challenges and Observations**:
- **Data quality issue**: All rows had 2015 as the fixed rental/return year.
- Limited exploration due to project focus on ML model performance rather than in-depth data analysis.
- Potential need for data augmentation from other movie rental businesses.

7️⃣ **Impact**: **Enhanced inventory planning**, resulting in better stock management and increased revenue potential. 💰📈

8️⃣ **Recommendations**:
- **Price sensitivity**: Lowering DVD prices could influence shorter rental durations, as pricing is a significant predictor.
- **Rental rate adjustments**: Strategic pricing of rentals could optimize returns.
- **NC-17 content impact**: Movies with this rating are likely retained longer; additional analysis might refine strategies around these rentals.
